These notes were developed, in Australia over 2003 -- 2014, for use in R courses that were presented to groups within universities, within CSIRO, and within Government departments. Each new course offered the chance to extend and refine the content, and to add content that was tuned to the requirements of the new audience. The result is a somewhat eclectic mix of material. The notes are provided here with the intention that others will be free, with appropriate acknowledgement, to add to them, or to develop them for their own purposes.

The $\LaTex\$ files, and figures in the `figure` subdirectory, can be generated by running the R command:
```
knitr::knit('Rnw/intro.Rnw')
```
Most chapters will require several R packages to be available. 

The R package __DAAGviz__ is designed as a companion to these notes.  It gives access to several of the datasets that are used. It gives access code that will reproduce the graphs.  The most recent version can be installed, from an R session, by executing the command:
```
devtools::install_github("jhmaindonald/DAAGviz")

```
(As of March 15, 2018, the code files assume chapter numbers that reglect an older version of the notes.  This should be fixed shortly.)
