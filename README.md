These notes were developed over the course of more than a decade, for use in R courses that were presented to groups within universi- ties, within CSIRO, and within Government departments. Each new course offered the chance to extend and refine the content, and to add content that was tuned to the requirements of the new audience. The result is a somewhat eclectic mix of material. The notes are provided here with the intention that others will be free to add to them, or to develop them for their own purposes.
The $\LaTex\$ files, and figures in the `figure` subdirectory, can be generated by running, from the project directory, commands of the form
```
knitr::knit('Rnw/intro.Rnw')
```
Most of the chapters will require several R packages to be available.
