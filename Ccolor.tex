These graphs are included separately because they benefit from
explanatory annotation and/or do require color to be effective.

\subsection*{Florence Nightingale's Wedge Plot}\label{sec:wedge}

\marginnote[-24pt]{The name `coxcomb' arose from a misreading of
  Florence Nightingale's \textit{Mortality of the British Army} that
  was an annex to a larger official report. See {\small
    \url{http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/small.htm}}}

Figure \ref{col:wedgeplot} is a `wedge' plot that shows the
mortality of British troops according to cause in the Crimean War over
1853-1853. It has often been called a `coxcomb' plot -- a name that
suits this imaginative form of graphical presentation.

\begin{figure*}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.97\textwidth]{colorArt/allwedge}}%
\caption{Deaths (per 1000 per annum), up to and after the
  Sanitary Commission's visit in March 1855.  Areas, measured from the
centres of the common vertices, are proportional
  to mortalities..\label{col:wedgeplot}}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{col:wedgeplot} is used here to show abilities in
\textit{ggplot2}.  The wedge plot is not ideal for giving an accurate
sense of the data.  It is not however easy to suggest an alternative
that is clearly better.

\subsection*{ Code for the wedge plot}

The url

  are from the data frame \txtt{Nightingale} in the {\em HistData}
  package. Subsection \ref{col:wedgeplot} showed how to create a
  dataset \txtt{Crimean} that is in a convenient form for creating
  this plot.} has code for the function \txtt{wedgeplot()} that was
used for this plot.  Note also the function \txtt{gdot()} that
gives a not entirely satisfactory alternative to the wedge plot.
